    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>Coronet Engineering was established with a single goal: to elevate the humble computer mouse to a new level of precision and elegance. What began in a small workshop in 2024 with a handful of enthusiasts quickly evolved into a passionate team of engineers, designers, and tech historians, each dedicated to reimagining the way we interact with computers through our hands.</p>

    <h2>Our Purpose</h2>
    <p>At Coronet Engineering, we believe a computer mouse should be more than just a tool - it should be a trusted extension of your intent. We combine cutting-edge sensor technology with ergonomic design and a touch of retro inspiration to craft mice that feel as good as they perform. Whether you're a digital artist, gamer, or productivity warrior, Coronet Engineering is here to deliver input devices that meet your standards - and exceed your expectations.</p>
