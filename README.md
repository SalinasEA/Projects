## PROJECTS

## OBJECTIVE
```
Vacation Booking Backend MVP (Capstone, WGU D288) — Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA/REST, MySQL, Lombok, Angular integration
Ported legacy backend to modern Spring: domain entities & repositories (CORS), transactional checkout service (UUID order tracking), and POST /api/checkout/purchase.
Seeded customers idempotently and added request validation; verified E2E with Angular (no network errors) and MySQL inserts.
```
```
Inventory Management Customization (Capstone, WGU D287) — Spring Boot, Thymeleaf, H2, JUnit
Customized UI/branding + About page; conditional seeding (5 parts, 5 products) with duplicate-safe “multi-pack” logic.
Implemented “Buy Now” (decrement product stock, success/failure message) and extended Part with min/max inventory, server-side validation, and tests.
```
```
Customer Retention Analytics (Capstone, WGU D326) — PostgreSQL
Designed store-level retention metrics (new customers re-renting within 90 days; average by store).
Wrote PL/pgSQL function for days-to-second-rental, detail/summary tables, trigger to sync summaries, and a refresh procedure (scheduled via pgAgent).
```
```
Core Java OOP & Collections — Java
45+ small apps and CRUD exercises emphasizing encapsulation, constructors, collection management, and file I/O; foundation for later Spring work.
```
```
Front-End — HTML/CSS/JS/TS, Angular
50+ micro-apps (e.g., Tic-Tac-Toe, To-Do, converters) plus an Angular capstone;
responsive layouts (Flexbox/Grid), API calls, stateful components.
```
```
Python Mini-Suite — Python
45+ CLI/OOP utilities (e.g., Password Modifier, Binary Converter, Vending Machine),
progressing from algorithms to class-based, testable modules.
```
```
SQL Labs — SQL
22+ tasks completed and gained experience with Sakila and multi-table
joins/aggregate queries, DDL/DML schema design and migrations with PK/FK
relationships and constraints, ER design data modeling, transactions, cascades, and
stored routines/triggers for derived data and checks demonstrating end-to-end
database development and analysis skills.
```
```
UI/UX — Figma
Produced 2 projects with research-backed flows, wireframes, and responsive
components for a travel concept and a pet-services app; focused on information
architecture and accessible interaction patterns.
